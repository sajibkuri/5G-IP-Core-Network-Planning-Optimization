# 5G-IP-Core-Network-Planning-Optimization
5G Network Simulation

In our project, we have focused on IP Network for 5G and provided a simulated solution based on Huawei Versatile Routing Platform Software. 

We proposed a hierarchical architecture H-VPN solution for a 5G network consisting of an access layer, an aggregation layer, and a core layer. 

NETWORK REQUIREMENT:

Operating System Windows 10

Simulator Huawei Versatile Routing Platform Software
VRP (R) software, Version 5.110 (eNSP V100R001C00)

Network Device Routers-AR1220-S
Protocol IS-IS, BGP, MPLS

Core Nodes (Dummy) 5G OTN, g-NodeB, IoT Gateway, Billing Server, 5G-RNC, Cloud Server

Topology and device configuration are added
